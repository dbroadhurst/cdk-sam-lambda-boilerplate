# Welcome to your CDK + SAM Lambda TypeScript boilerplate project

## Developing with SAM

Lambda development has started to improve. This boilerplate demonstrates how to combine CDK and SAM to develop and deploy Typescript lambda code

- `npm run cdk:synth` run this to update the build
- `npm run sam:run` run locally

- `npm run cdk:deploy`
- `npm run cdk:destroy`

## Useful commands

- `npm run build` compile typescript to js
- `npm run watch` watch for changes and compile
- `npm run test` perform the jest unit tests
- `cdk deploy` deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
- `cdk diff` compare deployed stack with current state
- `cdk synth` emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
